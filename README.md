# Mesh Tes2al

Mesh Tes2al is a chatting application that utilizes Steganography by hiding the content of messages in images ensuring the confidentiality between both initiator and recipient. The application is composed of a lobby chat room where all users can send and receive broadcast messages. In addition, a user may choose any other online user and start a private chat with them. The application is secured using different security elements including Authentication, Hashing, Encryption (AES), Key Exchange (Diffieâ€“Hellman), and Access control through private chat channels.
